My boyfriend really likes spicy food, especially **Thai food** so I decided to dress up as an Asian girl and surprise him with this delicious curry! But I have to do it right because **OMG** he is sooooo fussy. If its not **authentic** he wont eat it

As you can see above a lot of **exotic ingredients** go into a red curry.Some of these ingredients, like *lemongrass* are pretty hard to find in Prague, especially if you want them fresh, and trust me we want them fresh! But I discovered a Vietnamese '*potraviny*' in the old town near **Petrske namesti** where they often stock up on fresh exotic ingredients used in South East Asian cooking, a real hidden gem! **OMG OMG I cant wait to chop it all up and and cook!!!**
